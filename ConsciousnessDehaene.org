** CONCLUSION
   - Flying spirits appear as a universal metaphor for the autonomous mind.
   - Behind the bird allegory stands an intuition:
     - the stuff of our thoughts differs radically from
     - the lowly matter that shapes our bodies.
* Defining consciousness
  1. Dissection (examples)
     Often necessary, but not sufficient,
     condition for scientific progress is to carve out new
     distinctions that refine the /fuzzy/ categories of natural
     language.

     Classic example is the separation of the concepts
     of mass and weight or heat and temperature

     - Mass vs weight
       - mass ::
         refers loosely to the amount of "matter" in an object
       - weight ::
         refers to the force experienced by an object due to gravity.
       - an object with a mass of 1.0 kilogram will weigh approximately 9.81 newtons
         (newton is the unit of force, while kilogram is the unit of mass)
         on the surface of the Earth
         (its mass multiplied by the gravitational field strength).
         Its weight will be
         - less on Mars (where gravity is weaker),
         - more on Saturn, and
         - negligible in space when far from any significant source of gravity,
         but it will *always* have the same mass.
     - Heat vs temperature
       - Everyday intuition treats them as one and the same.
       - After all, adding heat to something will increase
         its temperature, right?
       - Wrong—a block of ice, when heated, will
         melt while staying at a fixed temperature of zero degrees Celsius.
       - A material may have a high temperature (e.g., a firework
         spark, which may reach a few thousand degrees Celsius) but have
         so little heat that it won’t burn the skin (because it has very
         little mass).
       - In the nineteenth century, distinguishing heat (the
         amount of energy transferred) from temperature (the average
         kinetic energy in a body) was key to making progress in
         thermodynamics.
  2. Initial intuitions
     - Consciousness 00 ::
       - loaded with /fuzzy/ meanings in everyday speech
       - covers a broad range of complex phenomena
       - we need to narrow our subject matter to a definite point
         that can be subjected to precise experiments
     - Consciousness 01 ::
       - vigilance ::
            the state of wakefulness, which varies when we fall asleep or
            wake up;
       - attention ::
            the focusing of our mental resources onto a specific piece of
           information; and
       - conscious access ::
            the fact that some of the attended information eventually
            enters our awareness and becomes reportable to others.
  3. *Conscious access* - counts as genuine *consciousness*
     whenever we are awake, whatever we decide to focus on may become conscious.
     Neither vigilance nor attention alone is sufficient!
  4. “Problem” with I and me
  5. “Problem” with “phenomenal awareness”
     “phenomenal awareness” is the intuitive feeling, present in all of
     us, that our internal experiences possess exclusive qualities,
     unique qualiasuch as the exquisite sharpness of tooth pain or the
     inimitable greenness of a fresh leaf. These inner qualities, they
     argue, can never be reduced to a scientific neuronal description;
     by nature, they are personal and subjective, and thus they defy
     any exhaustive verbal communication to others. But I disagree,
     and I will argue that the notion of a phenomenal consciousness
     that is distinct from conscious access is highly misleading and
     leads down a slippery slope to dualism. We should start simple
     and first study conscious access. Once we clarify how any piece
     of sensory information can gain access to our mind and become
     reportable, then the insurmountable problem of our ineffable
     experiences will disappear.

  6. Vexing issues of free will and self-consciousness can be shelved
     for later.  We can concentrate on the narrower issue of
     *conscious access* explaining why some of our sensations turn
     into conscious perceptions, while others remain unconscious using
     *experimental designs* that allow us to create /minimal/ contrasts
     between conscious and unconscious perception.
* Simple research program
** Aim
   Search for objective mechanisms of subjective states, systematic
   “signatures” in brain activity that index the transition from
   unconsciousness to consciousness.
   [[./illusions/]]
** Example 1
   [[./illusions/gray-circles.jpg]]
** Example 2
   [[./illusions/Bonneh_mib_table1.gif]]

** Expectations
   Is there a single pattern of brain activity that underlies all
   conscious states and that provides a unifying “signature” of
   conscious access in the brain? (Dehaene, 2014)
** Grounds
   1. Prevalence and reproducibility

      Illusions are eminently
      subjective—only subject can tell when and where the dots
      disappear in his/her mind. Yet the results are reproducible:
      [nearly] anyone who watches the figure reports having the same
      kind of experience.

   2. Objectivity vs subjectivity

      Emphasis on the subjective has been
      a revolution for psychology. At the beginning of the twentieth
      century, behaviorists such as John Broadus Watson (1878–1958)
      had forcefully ousted introspection from the science of
      psychology:

      #+BEGIN_QUOTE
      Psychology as the behaviorist views it is a purely objective
      experimental branch of natural science. Its theoretical goal is
      the prediction and control of behaviour. Introspection forms no
      essential part of its methods, nor is the scientific value of
      its data dependent upon the readiness with which they lend
      themselves to interpretation in terms of consciousness.
      #+END_QUOTE

      Although behaviorism itself was also eventually rejected, it
      left a lasting mark: throughout the twentieth century, any
      recourse to introspection remained highly suspicious in
      psychology. However, I will argue that this dogmatic position is
      dead wrong. It conflates two distinct issues:
      - introspection as a /research method/, and
      - introspection as /raw data/.

   3. Basic and BF method

      As long as we carefully record, on every
      trial, what our participants feel, we are in business, because
      then we can sort the trials into conscious and unconscious ones
      and search for brain activity patterns that separate them.

      We can probe the extent to which a
      stimulus that people claim not to have seen is in fact processed
      by the brain.

* Conscious access
** Basic facts
   Conscious access is, at once, extraordinarily open and
   inordinately selective.

   I can become
   conscious of a color, a scent, a sound, a lost memory, a feeling,
   a strategy, an error—or even the multiple meanings of the word
   consciousness

   I may even become self-
   conscious—which means that my emotions, strategies, errors, and
   regrets will enter my conscious mind.

   At any moment, however, the
   actual repertoire of consciousness is dramatically limited.

   It is precisely that switch from preconscious to
   conscious, suddenly letting a piece of information into
   awareness,
** Not to be confused with attention
   We need to distinguish conscious access from mere attention.

   In The Principles of Psychology (1890), William James proposed a
   famous definition.
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   [Attention, he said, is] “the taking possession by the mind, in
   clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several
   simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought.”
   #+END_QUOTE

   This definition actually conflates two different notions with
   distinct brain mechanisms: selection and access.

   “Taking possession by the mind” is essentially what I have called
   conscious access.

   That aspect of attention, almost by definition, coincides with
   consciousness: when an object takes possession of our mind such
   that we can report it (verbally or by gesturing), then we are
   conscious of it.

   James’s definition also includes a second concept: the
   isolation of one out of many possible trains of thought, which we
   now call “selective attention.” At any moment, our sensory
   environment is buzzing with myriad potential perceptions.

   Clearly, most if not all of the selective functions of
   attention have to operate outside our awareness.

   Selective attention and conscious access are distinct processes!!!
** Not to be confused with vigilance
   AKA: “intransitive consciousness”.

   In English,
   the adjective conscious can be transitive: we can be conscious of
   a trend, a touch, a tingle, or a toothache. In this case, the
   word denotes “conscious access,” the fact that an object may or
   may not enter our awareness.

   But conscious can also be
   intransitive, as when we say “the wounded soldier remained
   conscious.” Here it refers to a state with many gradations. In
   this sense, consciousness is a general faculty that we lose
   during sleep, when we faint, or when we undergo general
   anesthesia.

   To avoid confusion, scientists often refer to this sense of
   consciousness as “wakefulness” or “vigilance.”

** Relation between conscious access, wakefulness and vigilance
   Wakefulness, vigilance, and attention are just enabling
   conditions for conscious access.

   They are necessary but not always sufficient to make us aware of a
   specific piece of information.

   For instance, some patients, following a small stroke in the visual
   cortex, may become color-blind. These patients are still awake and
   attentive: their vigilance is intact, and so is their capacity to
   attend. But the loss of a small circuit specialized in color
   perception prevents them from gaining access to this aspect of the
   world.

   Patients in a vegetative state who still awaken in the
   morning and fall asleep at night—yet do not seem to access any
   information consciously during their waking time. Their
   wakefulness is intact, yet their impaired brain no longer seems
   able to sustain conscious states.

** Not to be confused with self
   Mirror recognition need not indicate consciousness. It
   could be accomplished by an utterly unconscious device that
   merely predicts how the body should look and move and that
   adjusts its movements based on a comparison of these predictions
   with the actual visual stimulation—as when I thoughtlessly use a
   mirror to shave.

   In my view, self-consciousness is much like consciousness
   of color or sound. Becoming conscious of some aspect of myself
   could just be another form of conscious access in which the
   information being accessed is not sensory in nature but concerns
   one of the various mental representations of “me”—my body, my
   behavior, my feelings, or my thoughts.

   What is special and fascinating about self-consciousness is that
   it seems to include a strange loop.  When I reflect upon myself,
   the “I” appears twice, both as the perceiver and as the
   perceived.

   How is this possible? This recursive sense of
   consciousness is what cognitive scientists call /metacognition/ :
   the capacity to think about one’s own mind.

   The French positivist
   philosopher Auguste Comte (1798–1857) considered this a logical
   impossibility. “The thinking individual,” he wrote, “could not
   divide into two, one reasoning, the other watching the reasoning.
   The observed organ and the observing organ being identical in
   this case, how could the observation be made?”

   Comte was wrong, however: as John Stuart Mill immediately noted,
   the paradox dissolves when the observing and the observed are
   encoded at different times or within different systems. One brain
   system may notice when another fails. We do it all the time, as
   when we experience a word on the tip of our tongue (we know we
   should know), notice a reasoning error (we know we erred), or
   brood over a failed exam (we know we studied, we thought we knew
   the answers, and we cannot imagine why we failed). Some areas of
   the prefrontal cortex monitor our plans, attach confidence to our
   decisions, and detect our errors.
** Not to be confused with “qualia”
   Some philosophers still think that none of the above ideas will
   suffice to solve the problem. The heart of the problem, they
   believe, lies in another sense of consciousness, which they call
   “phenomenal awareness”: the intuitive feeling, present in all of
   us, that our internal experiences possess exclusive qualities,
   unique qualiasuch as the exquisite sharpness of tooth pain or the
   inimitable greenness of a fresh leaf.

   These inner qualities, they argue, can never be reduced to a
   scientific neuronal description; by nature, they are personal and
   subjective, and thus they defy any exhaustive verbal communication
   to others. But I disagree, and I will argue that the notion of a
   phenomenal consciousness that is distinct from conscious access is
   highly misleading and leads down a slippery slope to dualism. We
   should start simple and first study conscious access. Once we
   clarify how any piece of sensory information can gain access to our
   mind and become reportable, then the insurmountable problem of our
   ineffable experiences will disappear.

   My opinion is that Chalmers swapped the labels: it is the “easy”
   problem that is hard, while the hard problem just seems hard because
   it engages ill-defined intuitions. Once our intuition is educated by
   cognitive neuroscience and computer simulations, Chalmers’s hard
   problem will evaporate.

* Global Neuronal Workspace
  We propose that consciousness is global information broadcasting
  within the cortex: it arises from a neuronal network whose raison
  d’être is the massive sharing of pertinent information throughout
  the brain.

  Thus consciousness has a precise role to play in the computational
  economy of the brain—it selects, amplifies, and propagates relevant
  thoughts (Dehaene, 2014, p.27)

  [+ Backprop]

  We believe that a special set of neurons diffuses
  conscious messages throughout the brain: giant cells whose long
  axons crisscross the cortex, interconnecting it into an
  integrated whole. Computer simulations of this architecture have
  reproduced our main experimental findings. When enough brain
  regions agree about the importance of incoming sensory
  information, they synchronize into a large-scale state of global
  communication.

  Once information is conscious, it can enter into a long
  series of arbitrary operations—it is no longer processed in a
  reflexive manner but can be pondered and reoriented at will.

  Equally fundamental to the global neuronal workspace is its
  autonomy. Recent studies have revealed that the brain is the seat
  of intense spontaneous activity. It is constantly traversed by
  global patterns of internal activity that originate not from the
  external world but from within, from the neurons’ peculiar
  capacity to self-activate in a partly random fashion.
